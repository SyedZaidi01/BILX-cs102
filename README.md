The BIL X application is geared towards the academic market where increasingly frustrated students and professors find it hard to manage and stay up-to-date with the various events, seminars and colloquiums being held at their university. The root of the problem is the bureaucratic system that makes the mundane task of sending and enabling students and professors to stay on top of university events arduous. The process specifically at Bilkent University involves the student clubs sending their events for the day to BAIS who compile them in usually one or two long emails and send them to the general student body. In addition, individual departments also send seminar emails to students. This can often lead to a huge clog up in students’ as well as professors’ inbox and spam folders. Therefore, we propose an an-droid application which acts as a platform removing the red tape from this simple process and providing both students and professors with increased customization of their activities. The BIL X application will enable users to filter events according to personal preferences and add them to their free time. University-wide news from the university administration such as blood donation requests will be of the highest priority with pop-up notifications for this enabled in the app by default. Hence, this will enable students who previously found the task of managing student activities tedious to now optimally manage their time and interests and balance them with their studies.
